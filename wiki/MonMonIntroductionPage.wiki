= Introduction =

MonMon uses Scintilla to create a pleasant Lua IDE (http://www.lua.org/). 

= Helping Out =

If you'd like to contribute - you are more than welcome. I recommend Visual Studio Express to edit the C# code.

You will also need Scintilla and NUnit

ScintillaNET(http://www.codeplex.com/ScintillaNET) and NUnit(http://www.nunit.org/).

If it's possible please write unit tests for your code :D

The project is currently very usable but in the early stages. This means there's not a lot of code so it's easy to understand pretty much everything that's going on.

= Features =

  * Multiple tabs
  * Find All
  * Function listing
  * Full syntax highlighting for LUA

= Coming features =

  * More comphrehsive function listing 
    * Ordering
    * Id broken function / malformed
    * Sorting function display
    * Allow code to have the functions sorted.
    * Close multiple files from the file tab
    * Change the numbers so they're not an awful light brown (same with braces)
