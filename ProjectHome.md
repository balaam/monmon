# Introduction #

MonMon uses Scintilla to create a pleasant Lua IDE (http://www.lua.org/).

# Helping Out #

If you'd like to contribute - you are more than welcome. I recommend Visual Studio Express to edit the C# code.

You will also need Scintilla and NUnit

ScintillaNET(http://www.codeplex.com/ScintillaNET) DockPanel Suite(http://sourceforge.net/projects/dockpanelsuite/) and NUnit(http://www.nunit.org/).

If it's possible please write unit tests for your code :D If you want to know where to start I'm happy to help and suggest tasks :D

The project is currently very usable but in the early stages. This means there's not a lot of code so it's easy to understand pretty much everything that's going on.
